Website about drivers in F1. They can register to the list and edit some example info abot themselfes. It shows also profiles of teams. 
Also It can show some latest news about teams or drivers. It fetches it from some news api.

You can see if there's an ongoing race(it shows, let's say whole module about It)

Also It collects data about tracks and can show It.

In the future It can collect data about race stats.

It shows whether given driver was a wc or not and also their stats in races(in progress because It's hard to get the data).
